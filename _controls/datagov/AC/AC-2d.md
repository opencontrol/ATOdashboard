`18F specifies authorized users of the information system, group and role membership, and access authorizations (i.e., privileges) and other attributes (as required) for each account
`

```
All accounts will be documented within their respective information systems, detailing their group and role membership, and access authorizations. This documentation will be exported by the OCISO and/or DevOps and archived for up to a year from the date of account creation by the managing 18F project lead and Cloud Foundry Information System Technical Point of Contact (Operating Environment) in accordance with best business and security practices.
```
